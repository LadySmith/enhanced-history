A note for the curious
======================

This is a fork `Better History`, which was sold by the original author and had hijack links added to it.
All hijacks have been removed, and permissions restored.

* Work is in progress to make this a **fully offline** extension to avoid such complications.

Enhanced History for Chrome
===========================

Chrome is an excellent browser, but browsing your history kinda stinks.

Manual Installation
----------------

1. Clone this repo locally or download and unzip
3. To Install the repo's directory as an extension open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
   - The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
4. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
5. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

Any changes you make to your cloned repo or directory will be seen immediately in the installed extension. Though sometimes changing translation files (in _locales/) requires a manual extension refresh in Chrome's extension settings.
